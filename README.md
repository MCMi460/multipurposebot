# MultiPurpose Bot

What does it do? Check out the [command list][commands] compiled by yours truly :)

You can feel free to host the bot, but I've got a [free of charge self-hosted version here][invite] for you!

Remember, if you're hosting the bot yourself, you'll need to make sure you have all the modules imported in [bot.py][bot].

> Extra notice: You'll need to enable the "Server Members" Intent on your bot's application screen if you want the "getuser" command to work for users other than yourself.

You don't have to give credit to me. That's not what Github is for (in my opinion).
