### [Download current master.zip][master]

What does it do? Check out the [command list][commands]!

You can feel free to host the bot, but I've got a [free of charge self-hosted version here][invite]\* for you!

> Notice: You'll need to enable the "Server Members" Intent on your bot's application screen if you want the "getuser" command to work for users other than yourself.

\*Not all features available can be used in the public version

## Requirements:

If you have any issues, [contact me here][support].

You don't have to give credit to me. That's not what Github is for (in my opinion).
